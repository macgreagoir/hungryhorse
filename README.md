===========

Hungry Horse is a AJAX-based web site framework that generates content on the server-side from Markdown.

The content can be static (pre-generated) or generated in real time from a Perl CGI script.

Hungry Horse could be fed from other sources too, like JSON objects, with a wee bit more work on the client side.
